You are observing players in a MineCraft experiment, whose goal is to create a specific block.

Rules:
0. Stacking two blocks makes a new block based on a recipe.
1. You and your partner know different recipes for stacking blocks.
2. Only players can create blocks other than BEDROCK.
3. All recipes needed are known by at least one player.
